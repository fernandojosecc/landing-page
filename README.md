### What I Learned

This challenge helped me improve my understanding of structuring landing pages and designing user-friendly layouts. Hereâ€™s an example of CSS I used for styling the hero section:

    .header {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        align-items: center;
        background-color: var(--background-blue);
        color: var(--off-white);
        padding: 50px 20%;
    }

  

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

*   Improve accessibility with better ARIA attributes.
    
*   Implement more interactive elements using JavaScript.
    
*   Optimize performance with better image handling and lazy loading.
